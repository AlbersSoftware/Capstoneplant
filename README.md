# About this project
 In this project I used JupyterLab as 
my environment. I created a custom 
ipykernel and implemented a 
convolutional neural network using 
the Keras library from TensorFlow. I 
created a UI with Tkinter that lets a 
user upload an image from their 
directory and run it against the 
trained model to identify it as either 
toxic or non-toxic. This UI has a 
login screen with a few users set 
up. I have also integrated metrics 
from matplotlib to view the 
accuracy of the trained data as it 
runs through its batches. I designed 
this project in a way that adding 
more to this model is as simple as 
dragging and dropping .jpg images 
into a folder.(The 'toxic folder' or 
'non-toxic' folder.)
